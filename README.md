Underground App

Welcome to Underground, an app designed to help you discover underground artists and create your own personalized "must listen to" list.

Getting Started

To get started with Underground, you will need to have a Spotify account and authenticate the app with your account credentials. Once you have logged in, you will be presented with a simple interface that allows you to search for underground artists.

Searching for Artists

To search for an artist, simply type the name of the artist into the search bar and press enter. The app will use the Spotify API to find artists that match your search query. You can browse through the search results and listen to their top tracks to get a sense of their music.

Adding Artists to Your Must Listen To List

If you find an artist that you love, you can add them to your must listen to list by clicking the "Add to Must Listen To" button. This will add the artist to your list, which you can access by clicking on the "My Must Listen To List" button in the app.

Removing Artists from Your Must Listen To List

If you decide that you no longer want to listen to an artist on your must listen to list, you can remove them by clicking the "Remove" button next to their name. This will remove the artist from your list and they will no longer appear in your must listen to list.
